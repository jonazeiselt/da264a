/* HC-SR04 Sensor
  
   This sketch reads a HC-SR04 ultrasonic rangefinder and returns the
   distance to the closest object in range. To do this, it sends a pulse
   to the sensor to initiate a reading, then listens for a pulse 
   to return.  The length of the returning pulse is proportional to 
   the distance of the object from the sensor.
     
   The circuit:
  * VCC connection of the sensor attached to +5V
  * GND connection of the sensor attached to ground
  * TRIG connection of the sensor attached to digital pin 2
  * ECHO connection of the sensor attached to digital pin 4
   Original code for Ping))) example was created by David A. Mellis
   Adapted for HC-SR04 by Tautvidas Sipavicius
   This example code is in the public domain.
